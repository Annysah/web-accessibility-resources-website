          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Introduction</h2>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            Web accessibility is the practice of making websites usable by
            everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities. It involves
            designing and developing digital content that is inclusive and
            accessible to people with a wide range of impairments, including
            visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive disabilities. By prioritizing
            accessibility, we can create a more inclusive internet that benefits
            everyone.

            Why is Web Accessibility Important?
          </h2>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">
            1. Wider Audience Reach
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            Accessible websites allow everyone, including people with
            disabilities, to access and interact with your content. This means
            that your website can reach a broader audience, potentially
            increasing your user base and customer reach. By considering
            accessibility, you open your doors to a more diverse group of users,
            enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">2. Legal Compliance</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            In many regions, laws and regulations mandate that websites be
            accessible to people with disabilities. The Americans with
            Disabilities Act (ADA) in the United States and the Web Content
            Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are examples of such regulations.
            Non-compliance can lead to legal repercussions, including lawsuits
            and fines. Ensuring your website meets accessibility standards can
            help you avoid these legal issues.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">
            3. Ethical Considerations
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            The internet is a vital resource for information, communication, and
            services. Everyone deserves equal access to these resources,
            regardless of their abilities. By creating an accessible website,
            you uphold the principle of inclusivity and ensure that everyone has
            the opportunity to engage with your content. It’s not just a legal
            or business necessity; it’s the right thing to do.

            Key Principles of Web Accessibility
          </h2>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">1. Perceivable</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            Information and user interface components must be presentable to
            users in ways they can perceive. This means providing text
            alternatives for non-text content, such as images and videos, and
            ensuring that content is adaptable to different formats.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">2. Operable</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            User interface components and navigation must be operable. This
            includes making all functionality available from a keyboard,
            providing sufficient time for users to read and use content, and
            avoiding content that causes seizures.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">3. Understandable</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            Information and the operation of the user interface must be
            understandable. This involves making text readable and
            comprehensible, ensuring web pages operate in predictable ways, and
            providing input assistance to help users avoid and correct mistakes.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">4. Robust</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of
            user agents, including assistive technologies. This means using
            clean, semantic HTML and following web standards to ensure
            compatibility with current and future technologies.

            Practical Tips for Implementing Web Accessibility
          </h2>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">1. Use Semantic HTML</h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            Semantic HTML tags, such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>,{" "}
            <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>,{" "}
            <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>,
            provide structure to your content and help screen readers understand
            the hierarchy and organization of your webpage.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">
            2. Provide Text Alternatives
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            Ensure all non-text content, such as images, videos, and audio
            files, have text alternatives. Use the <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code>{" "}
            attribute for images and provide transcripts or captions for
            multimedia content.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">
            3. Ensure Keyboard Accessibility
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            Make sure all interactive elements, such as links, buttons, and form
            controls, are accessible via keyboard. Users should be able to
            navigate your website using the <code>Tab</code> key and activate
            elements using the <code>Enter</code> or <code>Space</code> keys.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">
            4. Maintain Sufficient Color Contrast
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            Ensure there is enough contrast between text and background colors
            to make your content readable for users with visual impairments. Use
            tools like the WCAG Contrast Checker to verify your color choices.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">
            5. Provide Clear and Consistent Navigation
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            Organize your website’s navigation in a logical and consistent
            manner. Use clear and descriptive labels for links and buttons, and
            provide multiple ways to navigate your site, such as a search
            function and a site map.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-1">
            6. Test with Assistive Technologies
          </h3>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4 leading-loose">
            Regularly test your website with various assistive technologies,
            such as screen readers, magnifiers, and voice recognition software.
            This helps you identify and fix accessibility issues that may not be
            apparent during standard testing.
